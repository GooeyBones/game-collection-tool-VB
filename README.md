# game-collection-tool-VB
A game collection tool made as a project for my Visual Basic class.

This is 1 of 2 game collection tools I'm working on. I wanted to try the same concept across two different languages. To see the meat of the code, take a look at form1.vb. 

This program allows a user to put a console and a game in two seperate fields to add to log their personal collection. When the user clicks on a console in Consoles listbox, the Games listbox is populated with that console's games. User has the option to save their collection through a save menu that serializes the file into binary. Additionally, the user can open a saved file by navigating to any place within their computer via file exploreer through File > Open. In the future, I would like to explore serializing into JSON format.
